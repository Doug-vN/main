# Live plotting of data input from an Arduino via Serial in a defined, extensible data format (see Arduino code)

# Based on pyQtGraph for plotting with speed. Adjust MAX_POINTS for slower/faster computers (esp. Raspberry Pi)
# Porting this to any platform that support pyQtGraph should be straightforward, with only the PORT configuration and the serial_line.strip() call being platform-dependent
